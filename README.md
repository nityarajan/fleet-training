These are the files used to explore the data and train the model

- Voyager Data: this explores the intial dataset and analyses patterns (Outlier Analysis)
- Cleaningvoyager data: this is the data cleaning process, including the vehicle clustering
- Voyager model: this is the flagging and model building for ML models
- Voyagerdl: this explores using a feed forward neural network
- Voyager LSTM: This explores using an LSTM
- Use voyager model: this is the testing of the final model and SHAP explainability
